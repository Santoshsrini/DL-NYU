# DL-NYU

This repository contains the assignments and notebooks of the Deep Learning course by Prof Gustavo Sandoval at NYU.

Under each HW folder, the questions, the solns and the notebooks corresponding to programming questions are included. 

HW1 noteook is on improving FashionMNIST classifier using neural nets and implementing backproop to train a neural net without using inbuilt pytorch libraries( using only numpy ).

HW2 notebook is on training Alexnet and finetuning a pretrained Torchvision object detection model to perform object detection.

HW2 notebook is on training GANs on FashionMNIST to generate images. 

The final project of the course on detecting barcodes using TinyYolo & Pyzbar is in a separate repository called "Deep-Learning-Barcode".
